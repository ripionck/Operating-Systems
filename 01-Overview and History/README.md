Overview and History of Operating Systems

## Overview of Operating Systems

An operating system (OS) is a software layer that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and users. It manages resources such as the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices, enabling efficient operation and interaction. Key functions of an OS include:

- **Resource Management:** Allocating CPU time, memory space, and other resources.
- **User Interface:** Providing graphical or text-based interfaces for user interaction.
- **File Management:** Organizing and accessing data stored on devices.
- **Process Management:** Handling multitasking and process execution.
- **Security:** Ensuring data protection and system integrity.

Operating systems are essential for modern computing and are found in personal computers, mobile devices, servers, and embedded systems.

## History of Operating Systems

### Early Developments (1950s–1960s)

1. **Pre-Operating System Era:** Early computers lacked operating systems. Users manually loaded programs using punched cards or tapes, making operations cumbersome.
2. **First OS:** The GM-NAA I/O system was developed in 1956 by General Motors for IBM 704 computers. These early systems were basic supervisor programs managing input/output operations.
3. **Time-Sharing Systems:** In the 1960s, systems like CTSS (MIT) and IBM's OS/360 introduced multiprogramming and time-sharing capabilities to support multiple users simultaneously.

### The Rise of Unix (1970s–1980s)

1. **Unix Development:** AT&T Bell Labs created Unix in the late 1960s for PDP computers. Written in C, Unix was portable across hardware platforms, inspiring many derivatives like Linux and BSD.
2. **Minicomputers:** Unix became popular for minicomputers due to its simplicity compared to Multics.

### Personal Computers and MS-DOS (1975–1995)

1. **CP/M:** The first OS for personal computers was CP/M (Control Program/Monitor), developed by Gary Kildall in 1975.
2. **MS-DOS:** Microsoft released MS-DOS in 1981 as a standard OS for PCs. It dominated until graphical interfaces gained popularity.
3. **Windows Evolution:** Microsoft introduced Windows 1.0 in 1985 with a GUI but gained widespread adoption with Windows 95, which combined MS-DOS functionality with a graphical interface.

### Modern Operating Systems (1990s–Present)

1. **Linux:** Developed by Linus Torvalds in the early 1990s, Linux became a popular open-source alternative to Unix.
2. **Mobile OS:** Systems like Apple's iOS and Google's Android emerged to power smartphones and tablets.
3. **Specialized Systems:** Real-time operating systems were developed for embedded applications like assembly lines and home appliances.
